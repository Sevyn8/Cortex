# Cortex — Claude Code instructions

## Spec-first workflow

- Read `/docs/spec/cortex_v2.docx` before implementing any module or screen
- Every functional requirement (FR-NNN) in a spec section has at least one test
- Spec drift: update the spec OR update the code, never leave drift uncommented
- Significant divergence → ADR in `/docs/architecture/decisions/`

## Coding conventions

- TypeScript strict. No implicit any. No @ts-ignore without ADR reference.
- Functions < 40 lines; files < 400 lines (soft limits — flag violations in PR review)
- No business logic in controllers/routes. Thin HTTP handlers → service layer → repository
- Zod schemas for every API input and output
- No `console.log`; use `@cortex/observability` logger

## Commit conventions

- Conventional commits. Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, ops
- Scope = module ID (lowercase): `feat(f01): ...`
- Include prompt ID in commit body: `Prompt: P1.1`
- Reference spec section: `Spec: §F01-FR-003`

## Branching & PR

- Trunk-based. Main is always deployable
- Short-lived branches: `{prompt-id}-{short-desc}` (e.g., `p1.1-f01-multi-tenancy`)
- PR required to merge to main. At least one human review for non-trivial PRs
- Solo dev OK to self-review, but use M4 Code Review meta-prompt between sessions

## Audit events

- Follow `/docs/architecture/audit-event-convention.md`
- Every mutating service method emits an audit event via `@cortex/audit-events`

## Error responses

- Standard shape: `{ code, message, correlation_id, details? }`
- HTTP status alignment: 400 VALIDATION, 401 UNAUTH, 403 FORBIDDEN, 404 NOT_FOUND, 409 CONFLICT, 422 BUSINESS_RULE, 429 RATE_LIMIT, 500 INTERNAL
- Use `@cortex/http-errors` package

## Testing

- Unit test coverage: 80% line / 70% branch minimum
- Every acceptance criterion from spec → at least one test
- Regression tests required for bug fixes
- Every widget and screen passes axe-core (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Stack constraints

- Auth: WorkOS (not Auth0, not self-hosted)
- ORM: Drizzle (not Prisma, not raw pg)
- Monorepo: Turborepo (not Nx)
- CSS: Tailwind 4 with CSS vars for theming
- Node: 22 LTS
- Package manager: pnpm

## Feature flags

- All new capabilities roll out behind a feature flag (`@cortex/feature-flags`)
- Flags tracked in F04; retire within 6 months of stability
